                    <div class="galathea_snap"></div> <br/>
                    Galathea National Park is a National Park located in the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. It is located on the island of Great Nicobar in the Nicobar Islands, which lie in the eastern Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal).

                    The total area of this park is some 110 square kilometres, and it was gazetted as a National Park of India in 1992. Galathea forms part of what has been designated as the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve, which also includes the larger Campbell Bay National Park, separated from Galathea by a 12-km forest buffer zone.

                    Many unique and rare species of plants and animals are found in the park, a number of which (owing to their relative geographical isolation) are endemic to the islands
